= Known Limitations

This is a rough-and-ready list of current-state features, planned features, and
non-features.

== Language Features in a Non-Working State

* Example, aside titles
* Verse
* Images
* Figures
* Inline images
* Anchors
* Discrete Headings
* Cross references 
* Section IDs are not auto-generated
* Custom IDs/reference text
* Titles for admonitions, asides, etc.

== Language Features Planned for Inclusion Later

* Hardbreaks-option attribute (which we shall include for our poet friends who
  don't want to have to wrap everything in `[verse]`) 
* Includes
* Tables
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/author-information/[Author
  information]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/revision-information/[Revision
  information]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/metadata/[Document
  metadata]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/doctype/[Document types]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/section-ref/[Section
  Attributes and styles]
* Paragraph alignment
* Substitutions
* Checklists
* Autolinks (for now, just use the `url[text]` or `url[]` syntax)
* `mailto:`
* `Footnote:id` syntax (this may not happen soon)
* Icons
* Keyboard/button/etc. macros (I mean to target "writers," first, then
  "technical writers" at some later point).
* Syntax highlighting for source blocks
* Code callous
* STEM and equations
* Automatic Tables of Contents
* Literal monospace 
* Deeply nested description lists (in the meantime: just use an open block)

== Language Features Not Currently Planned for Inclusion

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/audio-and-video/[Audio and
video]:: Maybeâ€¦ later? Not part of the current project target(s), which are more
document-focused.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/footnote/#externalizing-a-footnote[Externalized
footnotes]:: I think that it's clearer to include footnote text where it ought
to go (and don't really believe there are many great footnote reuse use-cases);
Supporting this would require a second-pass on the attribute parsing, which
we're not really doing at the moment. Can be added later, but no plans
currently.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/counters/[Counters]::
Given that these are a "poorly defined feature in Asciidoc," and I've never,
myself, found a use for them, there are no plans for support.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/conditionals/[Conditionals]::
This probably wouldn't be too hard to implement, but (selfishly) I've yet to
find a need for these, so have no current plans for supporting them. If this is
of interest, open an issue.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/collapsible/[Collapsible
blocks]:: Again, this feels a more web-oriented feature; at least for the
moment, we're targeting document creation.
