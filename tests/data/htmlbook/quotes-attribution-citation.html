        <p>[The Self-Taught Man] has lowered his voice and his face has taken on a roguish
            look.</p>
        <p>"What sort of adventures?" I ask him, astonished.</p>
        <p>"All sorts, Monsieur. Getting on the wrong train. Stopping in an unknown city.
            Losing your briefcase, being arrested by mistake, spending the night in prison.
            Monsieur, I believed the word adventure could be defined: an event out of the
            ordinary without being necessarily extraordinary..."</p>
