= This Is A Minimum Example
:replace: thing

It should, in theory, not fail to parse, i.e., there should be no
`unimplemented` tokens included in this document. In other words, nothing like
the example that follows:

----
    _ => todo!()
----

NOTE: This is a note.

== Allows for multiple levels, and `markup` in headings

Of course, there are many things we need to handle, including *bold* text,
`code` markup, etc., etc.

Also some{replace}s need to be dealt with, like attributes, and the
following:

* Unordered lists
* With things
And ordered:

. Lists
. With things, such as block continuations.
+
--
Such as this.
--

And really we want to include roles, e.g.,

[role="aside"]
This paragraph gets an "aside" role.

And open blocks:

[role="open"]
--
Some inside the block shit.
--

Eventually, too, we want to handle images, but maybe later. In the short term,
maybe we do quotes, like:

[quote, somebody]
____
This is a great idea
____

And verse:

[verse, Robert Burns]
____
My love is like a red, red rose
